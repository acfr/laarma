# LAARMA Setup

### Accessing deployed hardware
There are two options for accessing the device remotely:
1. Setup a vpn and connect via ssh (eg. tailscale)
    ```bash
    ssh its@laarma-01
    ```
2. Setup a ddns service and connect via ssh (eg. duckdns)
    ```bash
    ssh its@your-new-device.duckdns.org
    ```
